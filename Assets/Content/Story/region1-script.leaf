{@advisorEconHill}      Greetings. You must be the Director.
{@advisorEconHill}      I'm here to advise you on economic matters in Knoll County.
{@advisorEconHill}      As you can see, we are a chunk of blooming real estate.
{@advisorEconHill}      I'll give you the tour.
$call PanToBuilding("region1_city1")
// TODO: add system for translating tile names ("region1_city1") to localized display names ("Oakvale")
{@advisorEconHill}      There's the <i>City</i> of Pendleton Hills...
$call PanToBuilding("region1_grain1")
{@advisorEconHill}      Henrietta's <i>Grain Farm</i>...
$call PanToBuilding("region1_cafo1")
{@advisorEconHill}      And Bertram's <i>Dairy Farm</i>.
{@advisorEcolHill}      "Dairy farm?" Oh, please.
{@advisorEcolHill}      I would call that a <i>concentrated animal feed operation</i>... a CAFO.
{@advisorEconHill}      Right, yes. My colleague here will inform you on such environmental concerns.
{@advisorEconHill}      But back to <i>important</i> things. Like establishing trade routes!
{@advisorEconHill}      Start by opening <b>Blueprint Mode</b> to plan them out.

{@advisorEconHill}      With your <i>Road</i> tool selected, click and drag from the source to the destination. 
{@advisorEcolHill}      But don't try to build over any of our forests. Those are protected lands!
{@advisorEconHill}      And each tile will spend from our regional budget! Try to be thrifty.
{@advisorEconHill}      Click "Build" when you have the road the way you like it.

    {@advisorEconHill}      Nice work! Now the CAFO can buy <i>grain</i> from the Grain Farm to produce <i>milk</i>.
    // {@advisorEconHill}      And the Grain Farm can buy <i>manure</i> from the Dairy Farm to produce <i>grain</i>.
    $branch .farmsAndCitiesConnected
$else
    // Step 4: Connect city and dairy
    {@advisorEconHill}      Splendidly planned.
    {@advisorEconHill}      Notice the <b>receipt</b> that keeps a running total of your plan's cost.
    // {@advisorEconHill}      Now the Grain Farm can buy <i>manure</i> from the Dairy Farm to produce <i>grain</i>.
    {@advisorEconHill}      Now Bertram can buy Henreitta's <i>grain</i> to produce <i>milk</i>.
    {@advisorEconHill}      But who buys the <i>milk</i>, you ask? The fine people of Pendleton Hills, of course!
    $call PanToBuilding("region1_city1")
    {@advisorEconHill}      Draw up another <i>Road</i> connecting the CAFO to the City.

    {@advisorEconHill}      Excellent! Now the the City can buy <i>milk</i> and turn it into <i>money</i> using TAX MAGIC!
    {@advisorEconHill}      Well... really, the milk fuels taxable production. But it's magic to me!
    $branch .farmsAndCitiesConnected
$else
    // Step 4: Connect dairy and grain
    {@advisorEconHill}      Uh-- hmm. I suppose we can start with the City. I'm not picky..
    {@advisorEconHill}      With this road, the City can purchase Bertram's <i>milk</i>.
    {@advisorEconHill}      But cows need <i>grain</i> to make milk... And Henrietta just happens to sell it!
    $call PanToBuilding("region1_grain1")
    {@advisorEconHill}      Plan another road between the CAFO and the Grain Farm.
$endif

$call ActivateSim()
{@advisorEconHill}      Now that everything is connected, we can turn <i>grain</i> into <i>milk</i> into <i>money!</i>
{@advisorEconHill}      Aren't supply chains just WONDERFUL? Agh, I'm getting a bit teary over here.
{@advisorEconHill}      Now just hit <b>Build</b> and all we'll see these trade routes in action!

{@advisorEconHill}      Ho! Special delivery!
{@advisorEconHill}      Henrietta's grain farm imported some <i>commercial fertilizer</i> from an outside supplier.
{local @grainFarmer}    I love <b>Phos4Us</b>! My crops need that phosphorus, and it ships right to my farm.
{@advisorEcolHill}      Hold on! All those extra nutrients could disrupt the ecological balance!
{@advisorEconHill}      Well, I'm afraid this is the only economically feasible option.
{@advisorEcolHill}      Hm... I'm sure we can find a better way...

{local @advisorEcon}    Maybe so, but they simply have no more favorable alternatives.
{local @advisorEcol}    Well, let's make it less favorable. How about a penalty fine for runoff?
{local @cafoFarmer}     A fine!? I'm barely scraping by as is. You'd have me selling at a loss!
{local @advisorEcon}    Well, a fine <i>could</i> incentivize selling manure...
{local @advisorEcon}    But Bertram is correct. Selling at a loss could disrupt the supply chain.
