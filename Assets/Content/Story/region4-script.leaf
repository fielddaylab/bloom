{@advisorEcolWetland}    Welcome to Muskeg County, boss.

{@advisorEcolWetland}    We've dealt with these algae blooms here before...
{@advisorEcolWetland}    The phosphorus flows down through waterways into our marshland.
{@advisorEcolWetland}    We fear it could once again threaten our wildlife. Maybe SAGA could help us avoid it.

    And this old manure processor... It used to turn manure into fertilizer, but it was too expensive to run. Could SAGA use it to beat Phos4Us?

    That processed fertilizer could be shipped much more cheaply, all throughout the area!

{@advisorEcolWetland}     Hmph... Algae blooms. Nasty business.
{@advisorEcolWetland}     Seems to me we should reduce phosphorus runoff.

{@advisorEconWetland}   Now that we have a digester up and running...
{@advisorEconWetland}   What's stopping us from shipping out our own digested fertilizer?
{@advisorEconWetland}   We'll be like Phos4Us! Only our phosphorus is from manure, not mineral deposits.
{@advisorEcolWetland}   Do we really want to be like them? All that extra phosphorus got us into this mess.
{@advisorEconWetland}   Maybe so... But if we're efficient enough, we can outcompete them!
{@advisorEcolWetland}   That could <i>close the loop</i>... and stop the import of phosphorus!

{@advisorEconWetland}   Our export depot has sent out digested fertilizer...
{@advisorEconWetland}   This could be the start of a brand new market!
